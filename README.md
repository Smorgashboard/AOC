ADVENT OF CODE 2024

A series of poorly optimized, badly written and half working solutions to the Advent of Code 2024

Day 1 : Easy. 

Day 2 : Had a harder time with getting a clean solution for checking the gradual report changes and direction of the changes when removing a single report value. I ended up with a brute force solution of just removing every value from the failed reports of the initial tests and then checking if it the reported values would pass the initial tests now.

Day 3 : Fun with Regex. I used chatgpt for the regex part. I also created a loop that could easily be infinite if the puzzle input was different, but it works fine for the puzzle input. Not optimized at all and a very ugly try/while loop but it was a long day at work and I wanted to keep up with the days.
